# Event Detection


### DAnIEL (Data Analysis for Information Extraction in any Languages): event-detection-daniel
DAnIEL system implements a string-based algorithm that detects repeated maximal substrings in salient zones to extract important information (disease name, location). The decision of choosing prominent text zones is based on the characteristics of a journalistic writing style where crucial information is usually put at the beginning and end of the article.
